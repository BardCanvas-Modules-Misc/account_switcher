# Account switcher

This module allows multiple user sessions to be stored in an encrypted cookie for fast user switching.

Registered sessions are added on the user menu drop down.

By default, only Coadmins and up can register and switch accounts. On the settings page, a different user
level can be defined.

**Important:** this module requires the accounts module to be updated to version 1.20.5 to work properly.
